ROOT INSTALLATION
Default to using the fixed location and sourcing thisroot.sh to adjust paths

Currently, ROOT defaults to using python (i.e. python2.7) for all linking,
and ROOT can only be imported in python, not python3. I don't think this
will be an issue for me, especially with my move away from physics and into
the numpy/scipy/matplotlib regime, but it would be nice to test things out
in python3 anyway. Plus, I can't combine numpy/scipy with ROOT, since those
are compiled for python3 (and work fine right now, so I don't want to mess
with it). Like I said, maybe not a big issue, depending on what happens with
the STG detector stuff. Maybe it will just end up being my own personal
analysis code.

Tried the following on 2015-05-08 (12:35) with a clean root source directory
and it didn't work. I introduced another error, so I think I'm just going to have to live with it.

  TESTING FOR PYTHON3 SUPPORT
  Temporarily remove symbolic links in /usr/bin and replace them
    cd /usr/bin
    sudo rm python
    sudo rm python-config
    sudo ln -s python3.4 python
    sudo ln -s python3.4-config python-config

  CREATE LINK TO SHARED LIBRARY
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.4m.so /usr/lib/libpython3.4.so

  CONFIGURE
    cd /opt/root
    ./configure linuxx8664gcc

  RESET SYMBOLIC LINKS
    sudo rm python
    sudo rm python-config
    sudo ln -s python2.7 python
    sudo ln -s python2.7-config python-config
